Comments to the author
======================

1. Some texts in the Figures 3,4 and 7 are blurred and hard
to read. The reviewer recommend to redraw the Figures.
2. Chapter V shows not the discussion of usability test but
show only some case studies. The reviewer recommend to add
some more discussion for each experiment.
