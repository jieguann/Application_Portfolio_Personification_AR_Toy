Comments to the author
======================

The paper presents a personification toy and some usability
test results on it. The subject is interesting and within
the scope of the conference, but it is my opinion that the
paper has two critical flaws:
1.	There is only one testee, which is not enough
number to derive statistically meaningful result, and the
test is not systemically designed. Therefore, the analysis
results are simply unacceptable.
2.	It looks that the paper is not finalized. Several
major and minor editorial errors are found, and there is no
conclusion.
